/****************************** NOTES *************************************/
/************ Admin ************/
- Auth levels (Create only 2 for now)
- Create database for services
-- Use services DB to populate services page.
-- Add Links on services page for each service to schedule a service


/*****Database ideas for admin *********/
- create individual model for each input.

- *** create single model with properties for everything even if it dosent need it

- creat admin pages to work on sections reather than entire pages.

--------Refactor how FormInput component works to not use spread operator--------
-Allows to enter a type of input to change in the component/formgroup
-Allows to only create a single model which some may have extra fields 
---but will be able to use checks to better organize admin page and display information.
----AKA create a new component for "AdminFormInput"?

*********** Will need several models *************
